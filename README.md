# Complex-Fans
If we allow the magnitude and angle of a complex number (expressed in polar form) to range over an interval, it describes a semicircular region, similar to a fan; these regions are what we call Complex Fans. Complex numbers are a special case of Complex Fans, where the magnitude and angle are point intervals.
